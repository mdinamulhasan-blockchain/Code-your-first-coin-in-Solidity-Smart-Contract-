# Code-your-first-coin-in-Solidity-Smart-Contract

In this code you will learn following topics:

Address : Every account and smart contract has an address .it is used to send and receive Ether from one account to another account.

Mapping : Maps are created with the syntax mapping(keyType => valueType). keyType can be value types such as uint, address or bytes. valueType can be any type including another mapping or an array. Mappings are not iterable.

Event : Events allow logging to the Ethereum blockchain. Some use cases for events are: Listening for events and updating user interface A cheap form of storage.

Emit : Keywords use to call Events.

Constructor : A constructor is an optional function that is executed upon contract creation.

Msg : Keywords that allows us to access some special variables that are available for us from the blockchain.

Require : The require Solidity function guarantees validity of conditions that cannot be detected before execution.
